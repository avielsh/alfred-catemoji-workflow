# About
This workflow allows you to quickly find and paste an emoji while you're typing something.

I like to use a workflow instead of snippets because it's easier to find an emoji by further categorization terms.

If you're missing some emojis you probably need to upgrade OSX, or just [update emoji fonts](https://github.com/joypixels/emojione/tree/master/extras/fonts)

This project was inspired by [emoji-fzf](https://github.com/mvertescher/emoji-fzf)

# Installation
Download the [workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avielsh/alfred-catemoji-workflow/master/alfred-catemoji.alfredworkflow) and double
click to import to alfred.

You can assign a hotkey to the workflow in order to quickly access emojis

# Usage
`em <term>` - Search for an emoji, further terms will filter the results

`emw <term>` - Search for an emoji using whole word search

`emr` - View recently used emojis
