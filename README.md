Alfred workflow to search for an emoji by category

# About
This workflow allows you to quickly find and paste an emoji while you're typing something.

I like to use a workflow instead of snippets because it's easier to find an emoji by further categorization terms.

If you're missing some emojis you probably need to upgrade OSX, or just update the font - see [here](https://github.com/joypixels/emojione/tree/master/extras/fonts)
